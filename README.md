# Keylogger Detector

This project provides a basic keylogger detection tool using Python. It monitors active processes, checks file integrity, and detects suspicious keyboard inputs to protect against unauthorized key logging.

## Features

- **Process Monitoring:** Checks for suspicious processes that may indicate the presence of keyloggers.
- **File Integrity Check:** Verifies the integrity of critical files by comparing their hashes.
- **Keyboard Input Monitoring:** Monitors keyboard inputs to detect and alert on potential keylogging activity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `psutil` library
- `keyboard` library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-detector.git
   cd keylogger-detector
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil keyboard
   ```

## Usage

1. **Update File Integrity Check:**

   Update the `files_to_check` dictionary in the script with the paths of critical files and their expected hashes:

   ```python
   files_to_check = {
       '/path/to/critical/file1': 'expected_hash_here',
       '/path/to/critical/file2': 'expected_hash_here',
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script to start monitoring:

   ```bash
   python keylogger_detector.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Check for suspicious processes.
   - Verify the integrity of critical files.
   - Monitor keyboard inputs (press ESC to exit).

## Example Output

```plaintext
Checking for suspicious processes...
No suspicious processes found.

Checking integrity of critical files...
File integrity verified: /path/to/critical/file1
File integrity verified: /path/to/critical/file2

Starting keyboard input monitoring...
Monitoring keyboard inputs... Press ESC to exit.
Key pressed: a
Key pressed: b
Key pressed: c
```
